# SpaceShooter

## Description:

SpaceShooter is a 2D shooter created without the use of a conventional game engine. 

The game was programmed with C/C++ using the Raylib library, OpenGL, and my own personalized library for extra functionality.

All assets/artwork were created by me using libresprite and a SpaceShooter Environment asset pack by Ansimuz.
